# SentinelXP Roadmap
Watch this space for new developments. 
<br><b>NOTE: I might deliver in more or less time than I write here.</b>
# Alpha
<br><b>By March</b> - finished GUI, minimal functionality (settings files, settings editing, md5 module for future use)
<br><b>By April</b> - basic offline scanning functions (getting file hashes, comparing them against malware hashes)
<br><b>By May</b> - basic checking of running services and open ports, closing and killing them functionality

<br><h2>Currently done:</h2>
* function checking if user is running for the first time (if yes - creates config folder and asks if they want the tutorial)
* mainmenu layout (most buttons non-functional)
* tutorial layout (non-functional)

# Beta
<br><b>By June</b> - downloading and applying patches from sites like Legacy Update
<br><b>By July</b> - active port scans for things like DDoS/exploits

# Release
<br><b>By August</b> - packaged installer with all dependencies working on Windows 95 to Windows 11

# The future, far, far away...
<br>Making a version in .NET CF 1 for Windows CE
